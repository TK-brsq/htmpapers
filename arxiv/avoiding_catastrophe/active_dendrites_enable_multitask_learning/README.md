# Project: multitask reinforcement learning in MetaWorld using dendritic networks.


Experiments with multitask reinforcement learning, using dendritic networks, tested in MetaWorld.

For more details please contact lsouza at numenta dot com.

### Installation

Important: MetaWorld requires Mujoco. For information about installing and acquiring a license, refer to [Mujoco](https://www.roboti.us/license.html). Please install `mujoco200` as the Metaworld dependency included is not compatible with the new mujoco releases. [Here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/tree/392c6e538101116f7e3079ab4e0eb53380dbe71b) you can find an older version of mujoco_py that describes how to install `mujoco200`.

Once Mujoco is installed, create a new environment from the yaml file:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
`conda activate multitask_dendrites`

For proper logging, make sure to set your `WANDB_API_KEY=<my_api_key>` and `WANDB_DIR=<path_to_log_directory>` environment variables. The path set in `WANDB_DIR` needs write permission for the user running the script, so make sure to set the correct permissions (for linux, use the `chmod +rwx <path_to_log_directory>` command.) See [wandbdoc](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/environment-variables) for more details. If you don't have an account, create (a free) one to get an API key.

To save models, set the `CHECKPOINT_DIR=<path_to_checkpointing_directory>`. As before, make sure to set write permission for the user running the script.


Alternatively, you may use [docker](https://www.docker.com) to run the experiments in a container:

    docker build -t dendrite_mtrl .
    docker run -it dendrite_mtrl /bin/bash

### Execution

To run an experiment, first define a new experiment in a python module under the folder experiments. Please follow the example of other configs already created.

To run, on projects/multitask call `python run.py -e <experiment_name>`

### Results
